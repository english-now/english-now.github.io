Her childhood dream of travelling overseas was fulfilled when she got her first job teaching in Ghana. Later, while teaching in India, she met her husband-to-be, a State Department Foreign Service Officer. Together, with their son and several ever-changing, rescued street dogs, they have been on the move ever since! Frances has taught in International schools in Copenhagen, Curacao, Damascus, Havana and Santiago as well as private and public schools in Montgomery County.

Her most memorable one was when she took 20 middle school students camel trekking into the Syrian Desert to live among Bedouin families. In addition to working at English Now!, Frances also manages an after-school homework club at a youth center.
