After graduation from high school, I left Japan to attend the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Talk about culture shock! I survived the brutal Michigan winters, graduated from U of M, and took a job working for Northwest Airlines (so that I could jaunt back to Japan)!  Working for the airlines, I was able to travel to various countries, often at a moment’s notice. It was a wonderful experience. Then, after the birth of my second child, I decided to stay at home for a few years. I absolutely enjoyed my stay at home experience, and would not trade it for anything in the world. When my youngest was in elementary school, I volunteered at her school, which turned into a part time job in the beginning, then led to a full time job with Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS). Currently I am one of the four ESOL Testing Assessors for MCPS.  Teaching English was never on my radar. A year of volunteering at a local English program piqued my interest in teaching, and I decided to consider teaching English as a quasi- second career. I obtained my TESOL certification, and currently teach on the weekends and in the evenings.  When I am not working, you can usually find me at the gym taking a class or two, or being a huge foodie, checking out a new restaurant!"},
