    <h2 class="heading">Youth Facing Racism</h2>
    <h3>A Four-week Program for High School Students Engaging American Experiences of Race, Ethnicity, and Identity</h3>
    <p>This dynamic SSL program for high school students - offered by English Now!’s community service partner Washington Center for International Education - includes eight online small group discussions as well as a service project completed at Corhaven Graveyard, a historical burial ground for African-Americans who were enslaved in Shenandoah County, Virginia.</p>
    <p>This course has been designed especially for high school students with an international background (ESOL or otherwise), but students without an international background are very welcome to join as well.</p>
    <p><strong>Online small group discussions.</strong> Small group discussions - maximum six students - focus on "names" and include three units: Say Your Name, Say My Name, and Say Their Names. In the first unit, Say Your Name, we discuss the importance of identity through the framework of our names. In the second unit, Say My Name, students hear high school students' stories and explore ways to promote awareness and change around racism, stereotypes, and bias. In the third unit, Say Their Names, students will meet online with "poet ambassadors" from the <a href="https://freemindsbookclub.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://freemindsbookclub.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1601404905558000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRJFctWctjydjFoQvjmTABJM3FpA">Freeminds Book Club</a>. These young adults, who had been incarcerated in their youth, will share their stories and explain how reading and writing poetry has changed their lives.</p>
    <p><strong>Service learning field trip.</strong> In addition to the three units described above, the program includes a service learning field trip to <a href="http://www.corhavengraveyard.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.corhavengraveyard.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1601404905558000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZvg0brS30SKComieMusbRDSY3GQ">Corhaven Graveyard</a>. Corhaven Graveyard is a historical burial ground for enslaved people. It has been developed as a site of remembrance and reconciliation. Participants in the field trip will complete a volunteer service project to improve the grounds of the graveyard. Enslaved people did not control their own names nor the names of their children. Participants in the field trip will engage in guided reflection regarding the lives of the enslaved people buried there, as well as their names - some known, many not, along with completing a service project.</p>
    <p>Taken together, this program consists of four weeks of online discussion sessions meeting twice a week, plus a 2/3-day field trip on Saturday, October 17. **Students (or their families) will need to provide their own transportation for the field trip program, which takes place in Quicksburg, Virginia.**</p>
    <p><strong>SSL credit hours.</strong> The program offers local high school students the opportunity to earn SSL credit hours through WCIE.</p>
    <p><strong>Schedule and times.</strong> Online small group discussions meet Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4:00-5:15pm or 5:30-6:45pm, for four weeks, starting on Tuesday, October 6.</p>
    <p><strong>Registration and waiver/permission slip.</strong> Students must complete an online registration <a href="https://englishnoww.wufoo.com/forms/english-now-registration-form/">here</a>. Indicate you are applying for the “WCIE Youth Facing Racism” program. Students must also complete a waiver/permission slip.

    <h2 style="clear: both;" class="heading">Year-Round Community Service Programs</h2>
    <p><strong>Community Service for Adults.</strong> English Now! and WCIE encourage international residents of the Washington, D.C. area to consider volunteering. Volunteering offers an opportunity to speak English outside the classroom, meet people, and engage across cultures.</p>

SSL service hours are required for high school graduation in State of Maryland public schools and are encouraged in many private schools. For information about WCIE's SSL programs, see <a target="_blank" href="files/WCIE - Student Service Learning Programs for International Teens.pdf">here</a>.</p>
