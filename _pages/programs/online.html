    <h4>Online Small Group Classes</h4>
    <p>Online small group classes at English Now! meet on a platform called Zoom, for high-quality, easy access to the classroom. Zoom is easy to use. See the image to the left for what it looks like to attend a Zoom “meeting” (class). To join, download Zoom and enter the class’s Meeting ID or click on a link. Classes are small – six students maximum, and many are even smaller – to ensure a personalized approach and plenty of interaction online. And our online classroom permits you to meet classmates from around the world, as you advance in your English. See what an online class is like. Register to visit our school's Zoom online classroom - Thursdays at 9-10am U.S. Eastern time (or let us know when you are available) - <a href="mailto:info@english-now.com?subject=Visit English Now!'s Zoom Online Clasroom">email us</a>.</p>
    <p>Our approach to language education is far more personalized than most. We’d love to talk to you on Zoom (or WhatsApp) to understand your goals and to advise you on how to best proceed in your studies.</p>
