    <h1>Seasonal Programs for High School/University Students Study with English Now! During Your School Vacation</h1>
    <p>Improve your language skills when you have time to focus on your English. English Now!'s classes are
        probably very different than the ones in your home country. Our classes enroll a maximum of six students, so you
        should expect an engaging, dynamic, and personalized class experience. You will actually speak English - and you
        will know your teacher, your teacher will know you, and you will meet classmates from around the world in a very
        different classroom environment than in your home country.</p>
    <p><strong>Calendar.</strong> We are glad to welcome you to classes during your time off, especially in
        January-February (for students in South America), or in June-August. Many students choose to study with us when
        they are on vacation from high school or university studies, before starting a new phase of their education or a
        new semester of school.</p>
    <p><strong>Online and in-person.</strong> Our students have studied in private lessons online since 2015 and have
        been enjoying small group classes online since March 2020. We look forward to coming back to the classroom when
        it is safe to do so--probably in Summer 2020--but we will continue to offer fully online programs to reach
        students around the world, even when we are back in the classroom.</p>
    <p><strong>The academic program. </strong>Our small group Semi-Intensive/Intensive English Program classes &ndash;
        six students maximum &ndash; engage students in a dynamic online classroom environment, developing language and
        critical thinking skills that prepare students for a rapidly-changing world.</p>
    <p><strong>The school community.</strong> When you enroll, and even after you finish your studies with us, you can
        join dynamic community learning activities with our students and alumni from around the world. Check out our
        most recent Student and Alumni Activity Calendar. [ANDREW, PLEASE EMBED THE NOVEMBER/DECEMBER CALENDAR HERE] We
        host discussions and learning events, both online and in-person when possible, because we believe that the
        purpose of language is to build understanding among people.</p>
    <p>To get a sense of our school community, we also invite you to check us out on Instagram at @englishnow_wcie. We
        look forward to meeting you!</p>
