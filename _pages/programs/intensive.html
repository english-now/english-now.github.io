    <p>These programs are especially for high beginner to advanced level students who prefer a three- or four-day per week program that follows a curriculum. Classes are small (maximum six students), so students receive personalized attention. Classes focus on all areas of language learning – speaking, listening, reading, vocabulary, grammar and writing.</p>

        <li>Gain confidence speaking and develop the skills to reach personal and professional goals.</li>
        <li>Learn and review essential grammatical constructions.</li>
        <li>Expand vocabulary by using new words in context of engaging materials and conversations.</li>
        <li>Develop listening, reading, and writing skills for a variety of situations.</li>
    </ul>
