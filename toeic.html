    <img src="images/toeic1.jpg" alt="A student studying for the TOEIC test">
    <p>The Test of English for International Communications (TOEIC) assesses English language proficiency of non-native English speakers and is designed to measure language proficiency in an international workplace. TOEIC is a standardized test designed and administered by Education Testing Service (ETS), the same organization that administers the TOEFL. The TOEIC is different than the TOEFL, which measures language proficiency for academic study.</p>
    <p>The TOEIC test is more appropriate than the TOEFL for English Now!’s many adult students who have already completed their academic studies. The TOEIC is well-known around the world, particularly in Japan, Korea, Europe, and the Middle East. ETS indicates that TOEIC test scores are used by nearly 14,000 companies, government agencies, and English language learning programs in 150 countries, and that more than seven million TOEIC tests are administered per year.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Format:</strong> We recommend that most students enroll in private lessons for TOEIC preparation. At certain times of the year, we may be able to identify another student at a similar level, to form a semi-private lesson of two or three students.</li>
        <li><strong>Dates for Private and Semi-Private Lessons:</strong> At the convenience of the student. We generally suggest two sessions per week for 90 minutes, but more intensive lessons can be arranged, and some students may wish to enroll in another English Now! group class – and do a once-weekly TOEIC preparation session as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Preparation Outside of Class:</strong> Students should plan significant time outside of their scheduled classes, completing homework and practice tests.</li>
        <li><strong>Tuition:</strong> Varies depending on course format. Tuition for private lessons is $40 per hour. Tuition for semi-private lessons is $28 per hour.</li>
        <li><strong>Registration Fee and Textbooks:</strong> One-time registration fee (for new students only) is $40. Textbook cost depends on which TOEIC test you are completing and ranges from $30 to $80.</li>
    </ul>
