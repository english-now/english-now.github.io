    <h4>Online Small Group Classes</h4>
    <p>Online small group classes at English Now! meet on a platform called Zoom, for high-quality, easy access to the classroom. Zoom is easy to use - see the video on this page for information about how to join a Zoom "meeting" (class). Classes are small – six students maximum, and many are even smaller – to ensure a personalized approach and plenty of interaction online. And our online classroom permits you to meet classmates from around the world, as you advance in your English.</p>
    <p>Our approach to language education is far more personalized than most. We’d love to talk to you on Zoom (or WhatsApp) to understand your goals and to advise you on how to best proceed in your studies.</p>
