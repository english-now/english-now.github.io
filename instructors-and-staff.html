        <img src="images/staff/mack-emsellem.jpg">
        <strong>Mack Emsellem</strong> was born in Washington D.C. to well-traveled parents. His home was always filled with the cadences and harmonies of multilingual conversations. The path to his 15-year career as a teacher of English as a second language includes a B.A. in American Studies from George Washington University, a Master of Education degree from the University of Bridgeport, and a TOEFL teacher’s certificate from Lado Institute. Life stories underlie biographies. Interests and career pursuits led Mack to continuing studies in computer science, video production, screenplay writing, security systems, sales, yoga, and fractal designs. Years of travel and moving to new locations taught him to pay attention to details and keep an open mind. Then he met and married his kindred spirit, Juliet, who had spent ten years living and working in Asia. In addition to teaching at English Now!, Mack is a volunteer English instructor for refugees through the International Rescue Committee. His communicative lessons invite students to describe developments in their lives. Although it benefits the students greatly, discussions about their new adventures, everyday experiences, and future ambitions have broadened him as well. Regions of countries have their own distinct character, and each city, town or neighborhood he visited was the center of someone’s marvelous universe. Sharing personal experiences with his international students continually expands the cultural horizons of Mack's world. Mack has also recently focused on the development of lessons that connect English studies to conservation and the environment, an issue that should concern us all.

Because many students were learning English as a second language, development of student literacy in science was crucial to their learning process. Peggy developed lesson plans focused on vocabulary and students' reading, writing and thinking about science while they participated in hands-on and small group work. Her passion lies in teaching Environmental Science and the difference that field trips can make in the learning process, which was the topic of her doctoral dissertation at the University of Maryland. She has worked with students of all ages, from Pre-K to adult, including teaching pre-service educators as an Adjunct Professor at Towson University, and as a Graduate Assistant for the University of Maryland, College Park. She began her career as an environmental educator working for the Montgomery County Master Recycler/Composter Program during the start-up of the highly successful residential recycling program in the county. Environmental issues surrounding the Chesapeake Bay continue to be a focus of her life. After completing a Masters Degree in Environmental Biology at Hood College, she worked with farm owners throughout the state of Maryland to reduce nutrient input to agricultural lands, which has a direct effect on the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay. Peggy also enjoys playing flute in several flute choirs, and making quilts when she is not spending time playing with her grandchildren.
