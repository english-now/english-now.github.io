    <p>We take a distinctive approach to English language study. Our students benefit from personalized instruction in unusually small classes. Our group classes enroll a <u>maximum</u> of six students, and many classes are even smaller.

    <p>Serving the Washington, D.C. area international community since 1991, English Now! offers English language courses for students of all levels. Our school is conveniently located close to the Bethesda Metro, and we also offer classes offsite at embassies as well as at students’ homes or offices. In addition to classes at our school and offsite, we also offer <a href="online-programs">online small group classes and private lessons</a>, taking our personalized approach to language education to the world.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Special update:</strong> our small group classes and private lessons are all being held online, and our office in Bethesda is closed, in response to the global public health crisis and following the announcement made by the Governor of Maryland regarding public safety and school closures.</p>
    <p><strong>Our office is still open online and by phone—at regularly scheduled hours,</strong> Monday through Thursday, 9:00am until 5:00pm; Fridays 9:00am until 1:00pm; and Saturdays 9:30am until 12:00pm. We will respond to your email as soon as possible&nbsp;or are available by phone and WhatsApp, during office hours.</p>
    <p>We are pleased to welcome continuing and new students—as well as alumni around the world—to <a href="online-programs">online program offerings</a>. Learn English, learn how to Zoom well, and join from anywhere in the world. To register to visit our school's Zoom online classroom - Thursdays at 9-10am U.S. Eastern time (or let us know when you are available) - <a href="mailto:info@english-now.com?subject=Visit English Now!'s Zoom Online Clasroom">email us</a>.</p>
    <p>During this crisis, we encourage our students and their families to refer to official websites, such as those of the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">CDC</a> and the <a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/HHS/RightNav/Coronavirus.html">Montgomery County Department of Health</a> (which has some good video resources), for information about health concerns.</p>
    <p>The outbreak of the novel coronavirus reminds us how deeply connected we are as a global community, and how deeply affected our former students around the world, students and families in the D.C. area, colleagues, and many friends are, by this ongoing public health crisis. Our school community stands in compassion with the world.</p>
    <p>Together we can help others. Our school community is always committed to community service, now more than ever. See <a href="community-service">here</a> to learn more.</p>
    <p><strong>Engage.</strong> Our classes are engaging. Small class sizes encourage students to participate actively in class discussions. Research shows that small classes are one of the most important factors in excellence in language education. Participate in <a href="activities">student activities</a>, experience an active program of <a href="community-service">volunteering and community service</a>, and <a href="en-outdoors">get outside</a>, to better experience life in the United States.</p>
    <p><strong>Enjoy.</strong> We offer a warm, welcoming atmosphere to a wonderfully diverse group of students. Our classes are small, so our instructors know our students, and our students know each other. Our center is also small enough so the school community is <a href="student-services">caring and supportive</a>. Studying a language is challenging, and our joyful atmosphere helps many students persevere to achieve their goals.</p>
    <p><strong>Thrive.</strong> "Thrive" means to develop well, to prosper, and to flourish. We hope that our students thrive in their communication skills, their relationships, and their lives, through their studies with us.</p>
    <p>Our classes are probably very different than language classes in your country or elsewhere in the U.S. We look forward to welcoming you to our school or meeting you online. Visit us or schedule a video call to experience just how different English Now!’s approach to language education can be.</p>
